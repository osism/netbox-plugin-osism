# netbox-plugin-osism

This plugin is used on the Netbox on the manager to store and display
additional information in the Netbox.

By using this plugin it is ensured that all additional necessary
information can be stored directly in the Netbox and it does not come
to data storage in a second database.

In addition, this can reduce the use of many custom fields on the devices.
